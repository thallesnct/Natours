## About

This project was developed using only HTML and SCSS, thus somethings weren't implemented (like the links in the menu), but everything else is working properly.

The design was made by Jonas Schmedtmann (github.com/jonasschmedtmann) for his Udemy course "Advanced CSS and SASS". You are 100% allowed to use this webpage for both personal and commercial use, but NOT to claim it as your own design. A credit to the original author (Jonas Schmedtmann) is highly appreciated.
